This program was written by Dan Rabinowitz, and can be treated as an open source program.

This program was was created to implement a bi-directional bubble sort algorithm in C and inline assembly using 32 bit registers or 64 bit registers. This program also uses an elaborate Makefile which demonstrates the different levels of optimization during the compiler and linking process. A further analysis of the first level of optimization is offered in the text file entitled 'optimization.' The results of all the different levels of optimization in each system (32 bit vs. 64 bit) is shown in the text file entitled 'results.' An analysis of the compiled assembly code is shown in the text file entitled 'evaluation.'
